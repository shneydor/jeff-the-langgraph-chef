# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a minimal repository called "jeff-the-langgraph-chef" that currently contains only a README.md file. The repository appears to be in its initial state with no actual code implementation yet.

## Repository Status

- **Current State**: Empty repository with only basic documentation
- **No Dependencies**: No package.json, requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, or other dependency files found
- **No Source Code**: No Python, JavaScript, or other source code files present
- **Git Repository**: Initialized with a clean working directory

## Development Notes

Since this repository is currently empty except for the README, there are no specific development commands, build processes, or architectural patterns to document at this time. Future development work should update this file with:

1. Build and test commands once a tech stack is chosen
2. Project structure and architecture decisions
3. Development workflow and conventions
4. Dependencies and environment setup instructions

## Next Steps for Development

The repository is ready for initial code development. Consider adding:
- Project configuration files (package.json, pyproject.toml, etc.)
- Source code structure
- Testing framework setup
- CI/CD configuration
